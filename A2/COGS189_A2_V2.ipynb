    "## Overview:\n",
    "For this assignment (tutorial), we will be working with a BCI competition dataset, with the primary goal of classifying target vs non-target trials from a P300 speller. The data we will be using comes from the 2nd Berlin BCI Competition, and was provided by Wadsworth Center, NYS Department of Health (Jonathan R. Wolpaw). Please go to the following link: \n",

    "We will be working with **Dataset IIb**. Please click on the description of this dataset (pdf format is superior) and read through the page in order to answer the following questions\n",

    "<br>*(Hint: Remember that from our last assignment, the dt at 1000 Hz = 1ms, 500 Hz = 2ms, 200 Hz = 5ms)*<br>\n",
    "***Question 2:*** How long (in ms) was each row/column intensified?<br>\n",

The participant is instructed to only focus on one character at a time, until they are instructed by the task to look at a new character.*\n",
    "***\n",
    "***Note:*** The description of this dataset does not include the reference used. It took quite a long time to find, but I believe the reference used was the right earlobe as described in this paper:<br> https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/file/index/docid/521054/filename/krusienski_jne_2006.pdf\n",

    "This is the same group and the parameters for data collection seem identical which is why I believe the descriptions of that paper apply to the data we'll be working with. They also mention they have already filtered their data with a 0.1 - 60 Hz bandpass filter. We will still apply a bandpass filter with a 0.1 Hz cut off just to be safe.\n",

    "The owners of this data provided us with useful descriptions of the data, along with some matlab code. We will use their documentation to epoch the data so that we can train our classifier. We will be using linear discriminant analysis (LDA) for this problem, as it performs very well on P300 paradigms. Furthermore, this algorithm is rather intuitive. We will be using ```sklearn``` as it will make this assignment easier to follow.\n",

    "### Step 1: Design a filter\n",
    "The first thing I did, after creating some variables to store our sampling rate, dt, and number of channels, was to create a filter. I used the filter design from the previous assignment, a 0.1 Hz highpass, and a 30 Hz lowpass third-order Butterworth filter. Just like the previous assignment, we'll ```filtfilt``` to filter the data.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "We will create some variables to store important values regarding the start and end of our epochs, our sampling rate and our bandpass coefficients. The filter we will be using is a non-causal Butterworth filter. We will use a third-order filter, which due to the nature of using ```filtfilt``` makes it functionally a sixth-order filter since the signal is being filtered twice. Optimal filter design is well beyond the scope of this course, but in general, low order non-causal IIR filters are commonly used for EEG pre-processing. However, IIR filters are easily made unstable so great care must be taken when choosing the order and coefficients. All coefficients chosen in this case have been tested for stability.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "Here is the summary of our filter design:\n",
    "- Filter........: Butterworth (IIR), non-causal ```filtfilt```\n",
    "- Order.......: 3rd (functionally 6th via ```filtfilt```)\n",
    "- High pass: 0.1 Hz (low cut of our bandpass)\n",

For the baseline, we'll use 0ms to 100 ms after stimulus onset. This baseline window was chosen because every epoch contains information from the previous stimulus due to the small interstimulus interval (ISI).

Neighboring time points are also very similar and we could faithfully recreate our waveform using significantly fewer samples.
